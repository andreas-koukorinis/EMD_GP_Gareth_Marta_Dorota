\section{Gaussian Process Representation Given Splines Formulation of $S(t)$.}
As remarked in Subsection \ref{}, the EMD procedure required that the underlying signal has a continuous formulation. For the EMD to exist, the underlying signal $S(t)$ needs to be approximated. Such approximation is covered in this work by a natural cubic spline representation of $S(t)$.

The natural cubic spline is characterised over time intervals, where the local cubic is expressed in a local time window. The time intervals are structured by points known as knot points; in this paper, such knot points are placed at the sampling times. This gives us a representation of the original signal, identified by $S(t)$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{cubic_spl}
S(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \left(a_i t^3 +b_i t^2 + c_i t +d_i \right) \mathbbm{1} \left[ t \in \left[ t_{i-1},t_i \right] \right],
\end{equation} 
where the spline coefficients will be estimated from the original sample path, such that the representation exactly matches the sample values at these time points, $a_i = S(t_i) = s(t_i)$. We need to construct an analog continuous signal from the discrete one, since our basis decomposition requires a continuous smooth signal for the basis extraction. The number of total convexity changes (oscillations) of the analog signal $S(t)$ corresponds to $K \in \mathbb{N}$ within the time domain $t$, over which the signal was observed. Note that $S(t)$ is decomposed according to direct extraction of the energy associated with various intrinsic time scales. This is the property that makes it suitable to non-linear and non-stationary processes. One may now define the EMD defined in Section \ref{sec:EMD_background} of the signal $S(t)$ as in Equation \eqref{eq:model_x_EMD}.


Given the spline representation of $S(t)$, each IMF $\gamma_{m,j}^{(i)}$ can be obtained as a natural cubic spline, defined as $\gamma_{m,j}^{(i)}(t)$ with the following formulation:
\begin{equation*}
\gamma_{m,j}^{(i)}(t) = \begin{cases}
s_1(t) = a_1 t^3 + b_1 t^2 + c_1 t + d_1 \quad \mbox{for} \quad t \in (t_1^i, t_2^i) \\
s_2(t) = a_2 t^3 + b_2 t^2 + c_2 t + d_2 \quad \mbox{for} \quad t \in (t_2^i, t_3^i)\\
\dots \quad \quad \dots \quad \quad \dots \quad \quad \dots \quad \quad \dots\\
s_{N_i}(t) = a_{N_i} t^3 + b_{N_i} t^2 + c_{N_i} t + d_{N_i} \quad \mbox{for} \quad t \in (t_{{N_i}-1}^i, t_{N_i}^i)
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
A shorter version of the above system of equations can be given by:
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{m,j}^{(i)}(t) = \sum_{j = 1}^{N_i} \left( a_j t^3 + b_j t^2 + c_j t + d_j \right){\mathbbm{1}} \left( t \in (t_{j-1}^i, t_j^i) \right) = \sum_{j = 1}^{N_i} s_j (t) {\mathbbm{1}} \left( t \in (t_{j-1}^i, t_j^i) \right) 
\end{equation}
where $\mathbbm{1}$ represents the indicator function.

\noindent Note that, in the above representation, $\gamma_m(t)$ is not explicitly expressed in a functional form, as opposed to classical stationary methods where a cosine basis or a wavelet basis function is specified. Here, the basis can take any functional form so long as it satisfies the decomposition relationship and the properties stated on the IMF. A natural way to proceed to represent an IMF is to utilise a smooth, flexible characterisation that can adapt to local non-stationary time structures; we have, again, selected the cubic spline in this work to represent  $\gamma_m(t)$.\\
\noindent Given a mathematical representation for the IMFs, we must now proceed to outline the process applied to extract recursively the IMF spline representations. This procedure is known as \textit{sifting}. The first step consists of computing extrema of $S(t)$. By taking the first derivative $S'(t)$ and set it equal to zero, maxima and minima within each interval are calculated, producing the sequence of time points at which maxima and minima of $S(t)$ are located being given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{t_j}
t^*_{j} = \left[ - \frac{b_j}{3 a_j} \pm \sqrt{\frac{{b_j}^2 - 3a_j c_j}{9 {a_j}^2}} \right] \mathbbm{1} \left[ t^*_{j} \in \left[ t_{i-1},t_i \right] \right] \quad j= 1, \dots, K
\end{equation}

where $ \{ t_j^{*} \}_{j = 1: K}$ represents the sequence of extrema and $K << N$. Since maxima and minima always alternate, in \ref{t_j} the plus refers to the maxima, while the minus to the minima. Consider the case in which the first detected extremum is a maximum and the second one is a minimum; then maxima occur at odd intervals, i.e. $t^*_{2j+1}$, and minima occur at even intervals, i.e. $t^*_{2j}$. The second step of sifting builds an upper and lower envelope of $S(t)$ as two natural cubic splines through the sequence of maxima $e_2^s$ and the sequence of minima $e_1^S$ respectively. The upper envelope is given by:

\begin{equation}
\label{upper_env}
S^{U}(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{K-1} \left( a_{2j+1}  t^3 + b_{2j+1} t^2 + c_{2j+1} t  +d_{2j+1} \right) \mathbbm{1} \left( t \in \left[ t^*_{2j}, t^*_{2j+1} \right] \right),
\end{equation}
such that $S^U (t) = S(t^*_{2j+1})$ for all $ t \in t^*_{2j+1}$. Equivalently, the lower envelope corresponds to: 
\begin{equation}
\label{lower_env}
S^{L}(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{K-1} \left( a_{2j}  t^3 + b_{2j} t^2 + c_{2j} t  +d_{2j} \right)   \mathbbm{1} \left( t \in \left[ t^*_{2j-1}, t^*_{2j} \right] \right),
\end{equation}
such that $S^L (t) = S(t^*_{2j})$ for all $ t \in t^*_{2j}$. Next, one utilises these envelopes to construct the mean signal denoted by $m(t)$ and given by
\begin{equation}
m(t) = \left( \frac{S \left( S^{U}(t) \right)+S \left( S^{L}(t) \right)}{2} \right) \mathbbm{1} \left( t \in [t_1, t_N] \right),
\end{equation}

which will then be used to compensate the signal $S(t)$ in a recursive fashion, until an IMF is obtained.  The procedure is detailed in the following algorithm.

It is often the case that such algorithm does not reach a mean equal to 0; therefore, multiple solutions in the literature have been proposed as stopping criteria of the sifting procedure. For further details see \cite{Machine}. By exploiting the definition of cubic spline used in the representation of the analog speech signal $S(t)$ and the IMF basis functions, one can obtain a mathematical connection between the coefficients of $S(t)$ and the coefficients of $c_k(t)$ detailed as follows: 

\begin{Proposition}
\label{prop_cs}
The k-$th$ extracted IMF denoted as $c_k$ can be expressed as a cubic spline whose coefficients are a linear combination of the spline coefficients of $S(t)$ and the coefficients of the mean envelopes of the $k-1$ IMFs previously extracted, i.e.

\begin{equation}
c_D = c_0 - \sum_{i=0}^{Q-1} m_{D,i} = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \left( a_i^Q t^3 + b_i^Q t^2 + c_i^Q t + d_i^Q \right) \mathbbm{1} \left( t \in \left[ t_{i-1}, t_i \right] \right)
\end{equation}
where $c_0$ is $S(t)$ and $m_{D,i} = \frac{S(e_1^{h_{D,i}})+S(e_2^{h_{D,i}})}{2}$ and $Q$ is the number of sifting steps required to extract the IMF itslef.
\end{Proposition}

Note that our notation $c(t)$ changed in this proposition by becoming $c$ for a clearer proofs. The proof is provided in the appendix \ref{appendix_IMFS-coeff}.
